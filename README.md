# UID generation Tool for Active Directory

This tool was used to create unique usernames (about 10,000) for network users in Active Directory.
The primary objective was to allocate a username and also identify the user that was allocated the
uid. This was done by generating a hashcode for each user to avoid any repetition or replication of
users and UIDs.
